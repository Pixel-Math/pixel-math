1.5 Convexity $=$ convexity along all lines

Theorem 1. A function $f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is convex if and only if the function $g: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ given by $g(t)=f(x+t y)$ is convex (as a univariate function) for all $x$ in domain of $f$ and all $y \in \mathbb{R}^n$. (The domain of $g$ here is all $t$ for which $x+$ ty is in the domain of $f$.)

Proof: This is straightforward from the definition.
